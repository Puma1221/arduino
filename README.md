# arduino

Here I'll be uploading my little arduino projects. Not because I think they're particularly good or will be useful
to anyone else, but because if someone more knowledgeable than I happens across them, they might offer some advice.

The only project in here currently is called **metalica**. All it does is play part of the Song Master of Puppets by
Metallica into an 8ohm speaker. Eventually I may rewire that board for 3 speakers so the arduino can play chords.
